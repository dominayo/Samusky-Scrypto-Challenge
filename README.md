# Samusky-Scrypto-Challenge

**ANNOUNCING THE SAMUSKY SCRYPTO CHALLENGE – $15,000 IN XRD PRIZES**

Starting today, you have two months to create a working blueprint package for a Decentralised Finance (DeFi) product in Scrypto. You can enter with any DeFi product you can dream up. Bonus points if it’s something never done before or not possible on other chains.

It is expected that the winning entry be a working prototype.

The first-prize winner will receive a monetary prize in XRD and may be invited to join the Samusky team, further developing the winning code into a production-ready DeFi dApp for release after the Babylon network rollout in Q1 2023. Reasonable cost of living expenses would be paid during this stage.

If the first prize winner joins the Samusky team, he/she will also receive a sizeable team allocation of SMK tokens, thus sharing in the future success of the Samusky project. Further development of the product as part of the Samusky team is subject to mutual agreement by both parties, and the exact terms will depend on the agreed scope of the work.

**1st prize: $10,000 (in XRD)**

**2nd prize: $4000 (in XRD)**

**3rd prize: $1000 (in XRD)**

Judge: James @defiyields, founder of Samuskycoin

Guest judge: Florian Pieper @fpieper, Radix legend

- Final selection of the winners rests solely with the judges.

- The first place winner transfers sole rights for his/her blueprint to the Samusky project. The other entrants, including 2nd and 3rd place winners, retain full rights to their code.

- Winners must provide their full name and KYC details to receive the prizes. 

- Distribution of prizes and extension of any offer to join the team is at the sole discretion of the competition organiser.
